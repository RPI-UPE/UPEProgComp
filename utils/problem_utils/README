To use this utility: 

1) Write a default test cases file in 
problem_creation/defaults/${problem_name}.txt

2) Write a test case generator function
named ${problem_name} in problem_creation/generator.py

3) Write a solution and place it in solutions
it should take a filename for input
and write to output.
OR::: You can rewrite 
create_output to handle your input as you wish

4) From input_creation.py call 
create_all_files(${problem_name},n,d)
See the function to decide the values of n and d

5) Also from input_creation.py call 
create_all_output(command,input_dir,n)
where:
command is how to run your solution
input_dir is the directory created by create_all_files
n is the same as in (#4)
